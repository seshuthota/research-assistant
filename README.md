Absolutely! Let's craft a detailed `README.md` document for your research assistant code.

**README.md**

**Project Title: Research Assistant**

**Overview**

This project provides a powerful research tool powered by AI and language models to effectively find, summarize, and synthesize information from various sources, enabling you to generate insightful reports.

**Key Features**

* **Web Search and Summarization:** Leverages DuckDuckGo for search, web scraping to extract content, and OpenAI for accurate summarization
* **Question Answering:** Powered by Google's Generative AI (ChatGoogleGenerativeAI) to directly answer complex questions.
* **Research Report Generation:** Combines search results and summaries to create detailed, objective, well-formatted APA-style research reports with a minimum of 1200 words. 
* **API Integration:** Built using FastAPI for easy integration into other applications or workflows.

**Dependencies**

* Python 3.x+
* FastAPI
* LangChain
* BeautifulSoup4
* Requests
* A valid Google API key (for Google Generative AI)
* A valid OpenAI API key 
* API keys for LangChain (if using LangChain cloud services), and Tavily (if integration with Tavily is intended).

**Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/seshuthota/research-assistant.git
   cd research-assistant
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**Environment Variables**

Before running, set the following environment variables with your API keys:

* `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
* `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2` : Set to "true" for enhanced debugging
* `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`
* `LANGCHAIN_PROJECT`

**Usage**

1. **Start the API Server**
   ```bash
   python search.py
   ```


**Example Response**

The LLM Chain will return a comprehensive research report in APA format, including:

* A summary of relevant information
* An in-depth answer to the question 
* Source URLs
